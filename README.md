# Regression-of-iron-redox-state-from-reflectance-spectroscopy
In this project I develop some machine learning algorithms to regress the $Fe^{3+}/Fe_{TOT}$ from reflectance spectroscopy data (visible near infrared spectral range) and chemical data (oxide composition) of glass-bearing materials.
The spectra used to build the database were partly acquired at IAPS-INAF (Rome - Italy) and in part retrieved from literature data. The attached files contains all the information and the scientific literature source for each sample.
